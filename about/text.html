<h1>Welcome to my wesbite!</h1>
<p>
    This website is where I will host my projects, post status updates on my life, and blog about random things. To read more about how I built this website, you can read <a href="/blog/How-I-Built-This-Wesbite/">this</a>.</p>
<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    I am a computer science major at <a href="https://www.rit.edu/" style="color: orange; text-decoration: underline;">RIT</a>. Besides school, I like to think I spend most of my time working on software projects or studying CS (I don't actually track how much time). Other than that, I am figuring out life as it goes.
