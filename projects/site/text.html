    <h1>About Site</h1>
    <p>
        This site is my attempt at building a LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL PHP) stack. Around three months before I started this project, I made an earlier version of my personal website using the Django framework and its built-in SQLite database system. Since Django did all the work with user authentication, database management and even an admin page, I was basically all set and just needed to make the HTML templates and set up the database schemas. Let’s not even get into hosting. All I did was follow one very long and confusing tutorial on hosting with Heroku and “oh wow it works”, my Django application was up.

        It felt nice to have my own website on the Internet, but it wasn’t exactly what I strived for. I wanted to build my own website, from scratch. I was already mildly burnt out from this project so I left it off until one day I came to the realization that the projects and programs I was making needed to be “bigger” in magnitude. To give some sort of scene, here is more or less a description of what exactly happened: I was watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaILnmUYS_U" target="_blank"><u>jdh's Tetris OS build video</u></a> and thought to myself, “That’s so cool that he was able to build an entire OS from scratch”. And then I remembered that I want to build a website from scratch.

        Now “from scratch” is used loosely here. It should be clear that I am not starting from literal 0s and 1s nor am not coding up my own web server software or database system. What I am doing is coding with no backend frameworks; each element of my website will be handcrafted with pure HTML, CSS, JS and PHP.

        This is not the end however. I still have a lot to learn about web development and who knows what I want to do next. As of now, this site is where I will host all my projects and post random status updates.
