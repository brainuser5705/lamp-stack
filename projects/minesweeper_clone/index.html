        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            Around the beginning of 2021, I became a bit obsessed with Minesweeper. It started off with the command line version and after learning JavaFX from class, I turned it into a GUI.
            The GUI is a simple program so extra functionalities like chording, timing or any other features commonly found in Minesweeper clones are not implemented.
